By: `CS2103 W15-4`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::modeldiagram[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duty Personnel data.
* stores the implementation of the Calendar and DutyDates.
* stores the implementation of a Duty Personnel.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Personnel Database`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Personnel Database` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::modeldiagram[]

// tag::storagediagram[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Personnel Database data in json format and read it back.
// end::storagediagram[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::blockDates[]
=== Block Dates Feature
==== Current Implementation

The block dates feature is facilitated by PersonnelDatabase and was implemented for general users as they cannot be expected to do duties any time during the upcoming month.
They may have certain dates that are busy or do not wish to do duties and as such they can block the dates in the PersonnelDatabase.

Block Dates was done by adding 3 new commands to the `Logic` which are `BlockDateCommand`, `ViewBlockCommand`, `RemoveBlockCommand`.
Modifications and methods were also added in `Model` and `Storage` to implement the blocking of dates in Duty planning and storage.

`BlockDateCommand` works like other commands in the Duty Planner. The command is read a text string from the MainWindow in UI.
The sequence diagram for the interaction is below.

image::BlockDateStateDiagram.png[width="800"]


Step 1 : +
As seen in the diagram above. The MainWindow calls the execute Command in Logic and passes in the command text, userName and userType of the logged in user.

Step 2 : +
The LogicManager then passes the command text, userName and userType to PersonnelDatabaseParser and it determines the type of command by parsing the String input.
Using certain command words, the PersonnelDatabase Parser determines what the command is and then passes the parsed commandText, userName and userType to the BlockDateCommandParser.

Step 3 : +
The BlockDateCommandParser takes in the dates list as a String and parses it into a Integer List which is used in the model.
The BlockDateCommandParser then passes in the Integer List, userType and userName to BlockDateCommand.
It checks for valid Integer inputs for days in the next month and will throw an exception if the dates entered are not valid

Step 4 : +
The logic for BlockDateCommand follows the activity diagram below.

image::BlockDateActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

****
* The first check is the userType, if you are an Admin you will not be able to access this command
* The second check is to see the schedule has already been confirmed for nex month. If so the user cannot block any dates for the upcoming month
* The third check is to see the number of dates blocked and if they are more than 15, an exception will be thrown.
This is to ensure that commander have enough people to schedule duties. You can change this number if you wish to do so by updating the
MAX_BLOCKS_NUMBER in BlockDateCommand
* If the user passes all check the Command will enter Step 5
****

Step 5 : +
The BlockDateCommand then passes the Integer List to the model where it is stored in a Hashmap in DutyMonth.
DutyMonth has a Hashmap<Person, List<Integer>> blockedDays object to allow it to store the blockedDays of every person for the upcoming month.

Step 6 : +
The algorithm for scheduling was then modified to prevent the user from not doing duties on their blockedDays. This was done with the assistance of the HashMap.
During scheduling when a person is assigned to a day the model checks the list of blocked dates. If the person has a blocked day on the assigned duty, they are assigned a new one.
Someone else will then replace them in the previously assigned duty.
A more detailed explanation of the scheduling algorithm is in <<Duty Settings>>.

==== Design Considerations:
* Alternative 1 (current implementation): BlockDateCommand takes in a few dates they are then stored in the personnel database as a Hashmap.
** Pros :
*** Easy to implement as a new Command. Parsers have already been set up in address book and adding a new command is relatively easy to implement.
***The command storing the Integer List in the PersonnelDatabase in a HashMap is also convenient for the other commands such as `viewblock` and `removeblock.
***The Hashmap allows easy referencing for these commands. The Hashmap also allows for easier scheduling when the scheduler is run.

** Cons :
*** The BlockDateCommand would directly modify the HashMap in the PersonnelDatabase and this would go against the n-tier architecture of the PersonnelDatabase Program. This would break the abstraction principle

**Implemented Fix for Cons :
*** To combat the above issue, Model was given methods to add the blockedDates into the Personnel Database rather than the command itself.
This allows the logic to pass the dates to the model which would then integrate it into the Personnel Database.

 * Alternative 2 (current implementation): BlockDateCommand takes in a few dates they are then stored as a new Class called BlockedDates
** Pros :
*** Easy to implement as a new Command. Parsers have already been set up in address book and adding a new command is relatively easy to implement.
*** Would be clear what the BlockedDate Class does and also if other forms of dates such as AppointmentDates have to be added in later this would help with integrating them.

** Cons :
*** The implementation of a BlockedDate Class would complicated the process of integrating into the schedule much harder.
Implementing the BlockedDate into the algorithm would be a lot harder and would take more time and effort.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dutyPackageDiagram[]

=== Duty Package

==== Implementation


image::DutyPackage.png[width:"600"]

The diagram above shows the high-level structure of the duty components.
// end::dutyPackageDiagram[]

// tag::dutyCalendar[]

==== Duty Calendar

`DutyCalendar` is an attribute of `PersonalDatabase`. It comprises of three `DutyMonth` objects -- namely `currentMonth`, `nextMonth` and `dummyNextMonth` and a `DutyStorage` object -- `dutyStorage`.

* `currentMonth` represents the current month.
* `nextMonth` represents the upcoming month.
* `dummyNextMonth` is a dummy `DutyMonth` object that mirrors the contents of `nextMonth`.
** It is instantiated each time `schedule` command is called. The scheduling alogorithm is invoked to produce a viable duty schedule in `dummyNextMonth`.
** When `confirm` command is called, `nextMonth` will point to the `dummyNextMonth`.
* `dutyStorage` stores the accumulated duty points and duty records of each person.

`DutyCalendar` implements the following operations:

* `DutyCalendar#rollover()` -- replaces `currentMonth` with `nextMonth` and a new `nextMonth` object will be instantiated. `rollover()` will be called automatically when the application begins and the `currentMonth` object no longer correspond to the actual current month in real time.

* `DutyCalendar#scheduleDutyForNextMonth()` -- instantiates `dummyNextMonth` and runs the scheduling algorithm on it.

* `DutyCalendar#confirm()` -- confirms the latest duty schedule by allowing `nextMonth` to point to the current instantiation of `dummyNextMonth`.
// end::dutyCalendar[]

// tag::dutyPackage[]
==== Duty Month

`DutyMonth` class represents all duty-related information for a particular month. It contains the following key information:

* The blocked days of every person for duties in the month.
* A list of scheduled duties implemented as a `Duty` object list
** At the construction of the `DutyMonth`, the list is empty.
** When the `schedule` method is called, `Duty` objects are be instantiated and appended to the list. The list will contain the same number of `Duty` objects as the number of days in the month.
* A boolean `confirm` state -- denoting whether the duty allocation for the month is confimed.

`DutyMonth` class contains the following key operations:

* `DutyMonth#addBlockedDay(person, day)` -- adds a blocked day to a particular person, indicating that the person cannot be assigned duty on that particular day of the month.
* `DutyMonth#removeBlockedDays(person)` -- remove all blocked days for a particular person, indicating that the person can now be assigned duty on any day of the month.
* `DutyMonth#schedule(personList, dutySettings, dutyStorage)` -- invokes the scheduling alogorithm. Generate all duties for the particular month and assign person from personList to the duties.
* `DutyMonth#confirm()` -- sets the state of the `DutyMonth` to confirmed. Duty allocation is finalized.

==== Duty

`Duty` class represents a duty for a day. It contains the following information:

* List of `Person` allocated to the duty.
* Capacity -- number of persons needed for the duty.
* Points -- number of  points to be rewarded to each person assigned to the duty.

==== Duty Storage

`DutyMonth` class stores the accumulated duty points and duty records of every person. It has the following key operations:

* `DutyStorage#update(dutieslist)` -- updates the duty points and records from a list of scheduled duties. Used when schedules are confirmed and finalized.
* `DutyStorage#undo(dutieslist)` -- restore to previous state of duty points and records. Used when previous confirmed duty schedule has to be undone.
* `DutyStorage#reward(person, point)` -- adds duty points to a particular person.
* `DutyStorage#penalize(person, point)` -- deducts duty points from a particular person.

==== Duty Settings

`DutySettings` class is an attribute under `UserPrefs`. It stores information regarding the manpower needed and duty points to be rewarded for each duty based on the day of the week.


It is accessed when duties are generated to ensure the appropriate attributes (capacity and points) given to each duty.

==== Schedule Command

The `schedule` command is called by the admin to generate a viable duty schedule for the upcoming month.

image::ScheduleCommand.png[width="1000"]

The sequence diagram above shows how the `schedule` operation works.

It is worth noting that `schedule` operation does not finalize the duty schedule for next month. Therefore, `dutyCalendar` has to instantiates a new  `dummyNextMonth` for the operation.

Subsequent calling of the `confirm` operation will allow the `nextMonth` object to point to the latest `dummyNextMonth`, and invoke `dutyStorage` to update duty points and records.

==== Schedule Algorithm

image::ScheduleAlgorithm.jpg[width = "600"]

The sequence diagram above provides a simplified illustration of the `schedule` method in `DutyMonth`.

To ensure a system where duties are allocated fairly,

* We employ a point system where each person can gain points by doing duties.
* The points awarded are cumulative -- can be carried over to the next month. Duty points accumulated are stored in `DutyStorage`.
* Each duty is worth a certain number of points and a person gains that amount of points by doing that duty. The points allocated to each duty is retrieved from `DutySettings`.
* Before the `schedule` command is called, each person has the opportunity to indicate the days he are unavailable for duty.

Approach

* Generate a list of `Duty` objects sorted by their points in descending order.
* Generate a priority queue of all `Person` objects, queued based on their accumulated duty points with the lowest at the head of the queue.
* Iterate through the list of `Duty` objects. At each iteration,
** Poll the priority queue of `Person` continuously until an instance of a compatible duty-person pairing.
** A compatible pairing consists of conditions such as the `Person` not having blocked the day of the `Duty` and the `Duty` does not already contain the `Person`.
** Iteration continues after the `Duty` is filled or priority queue of `Person` becomes empty (cannot find compatible `Person`).
* The algorithm ensures that a person with low accumulated duty points will be assigned to duties that rewards higher points and assigned to more duties. This allows the scheduler to automatically balance the duty points of each person by the end of the month.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: storage of Duty issues

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Duty` class also plays the role of `DutyDate` class
** Pros: one less layer for simplicity
** Cons: less flexible for extension of the project, hard to ensure that each `DutyMonth` contains the correct number of `Duty` objects
* **Alternative 2:** create a separate `DutyDate` class that contains `Duty` as an attribute
** Pros: Easy indexing and reference for UI and other purposes
** Cons: `DutyDate` class does not have other roles, can be redundant


===== Aspect: Storing duty points of each person

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stored in external `DutyStorage` object with HashMap attribute.
** Pros: Reduce number of  dependencies -- `Person` class is completely freed from any duty information. Duty package operates independently.
** Cons: A lot of inefficiencies when querying duty points.

* **Alternative 2:** Enable `Person` class to contain duty related information. For example, adding a duty point attribute to `Person`.
** Pros: Simple and efficient indexing and referencing.
** Cons: Increase level of dependencies. Could potentially result in circular dependencies between `Duty` and `Person`.
// end::dutyPackage[]

// tag::swap[]
=== Request for swapping of duties
==== Current Implementation

*Swap Request Creation*

There is currently a Java class called Request in the request folder in the model package. This request represents a swap request that a duty personnel submits using the 'swap' command. It has 4 fields, the requester Person object, the allocated date (out of which the requester wants to swap) as a java.time.LocalDate object, the requested date (into which the requester wants to swap) also as a LocalDate object, and the accepter Person object, which could be null.

A Request object is created when the 'swap' command is entered by a non-master-admin user. Since he is an actual human user with an associated Person object and NRIC, he is able to request a swap if he is unwilling or unable to do his current allocated duty. This must happen after the duties are scheduled. Otherwise, the list of duties associated with the user is empty and a swap request cannot be made.

The swap command is wrapped in a SwapCommand object that extends the abstract class Command, just like any other command. The user inputs 2 dates, his allocated and requested date, and the 2 dates are parsed as LocalDate objects, from which the Request object is made.

Thereafter, the Request object is added to the personnel database through the model so the personnel database now contains the request in a list.

After this, the new personnel database is committed (making it undoable) and the listener in LogicManager is informed. As a result, the new personnel database is saved into the JSON file. Finally, the browser panel is refreshed to reflect the newest request list.

The browser panel was transformed from implementing FXML WebView to FXML TextArea. After the request list is updated, a new string is passed to the TextArea field for it to display in the browser panel.

*Accept Swap Command*

Next, there is a command 'acceptSwap' that allows a non-master-admin user to accept a swap that another user has requested (we call this an open swap.) The list of open swaps would be on the list in the browser panel and the 'acceptSwap' command takes in a positive integer as argument and this integer refers to the index number of the request in the request list.

Again, this is encapsulated in an AcceptSwapCommand object, which extends the abstract Command class. An AcceptSwapCommand constructor takes in the index mentioned above and the username (i.e NRIC) of the current user. It sets the accepter Person in the relevant Request object to be the current user.

*View Swaps Command*

The 'viewSwaps' command is only for admin users. It takes in no arguments and it is for admin users to view all the swap requests which have found an accepter (From now on we call these paired requests.) This command is encapsulated in the ViewSwapsCommand object. When this ViewSwapsCommand object is executed by the LogicManager, a string showing all the paired requests pending approval is generated and passed into the TextArea of the ResultDisplay. This allows the admin user to view the requests and then proceed to approve or reject them.

*Approve / Reject Swap Command*

The admin user can then use 'approveSwap' or 'rejectSwap' to approve or reject a paired swap in the list displayed in the ResultDisplay after executing the viewSwaps command. These are encapsulated in the ApproveSwapCommand and RejectSwapCommand classes.

// end::swap[]

// tag::authentication[]

=== Logging in and account authority feature
==== Current Implementation
* Note that in this segment, NRIC and Username may be used interchangeably, since the username is always the NRIC, unless using the default Admin account.

image::LoginSequenceDiagramDG.png[width="800"]

There are currently 2 UserTypes found in commons.core.index: UserType.ADMIN and UserType.General. Each NRIC account will be assigned to one of these user types that correspond to different authorities.
Note that Admin type user accounts are not only have access to more commands, but some commands (such as edit) have more functionalities as well. The Command class implements AdminCommand and GeneralCommand interfaces.

Upon entering the username and password into the LoginBox, the LogicManager searches the list of personnel until it finds a personnel with the same username and (hashed) password.
This returns the username and UserType of the account, and initializes the MainWindow with the username and Usertype as fields. The MainWindow then initializes the commandbox with these fields as well: the usertype so that the commands are executed using executeAdmin() or executeGeneral(), and the nric for several commands that require it to execute (for example, using the "Edit" command as a general account, since the account can only affect its own information.

image::DeleteCommandFinalDG.png[width="900"]

The execute Command in logic will decide to initialize the commands as either AdminCommand or GeneralCommand,
to ensure the user does not have access to the wrong authority level.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: handling logging in and UserType

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** LogIn box handles logic of finding account, MainWindow has UserType and NRIC field.
** Pros: MainWindow initialized with a final UserType and NRIC field, which in turn creates a commandbox with a final UserType and NRIC field, which is safer for the commands, making sure the commands will be created as an AdminCommand or GeneralCommand correctly.
** Cons: UI best not to handle logic, UserType or NRIC of user might be might be changed, but since the UserType and NRIC fields in the MainWindow are final, they cannot be changed. This might mess up some commands or functionalities that target the admin's own account.
** Implemented fix for cons: Login Box does not store Logic, but rather logic has a method to find the account given the NRIC and password, but LoginBox has a functional interface of the method as a field.
To handle security concerns of the user changing his own NRIC or UserType, the program automatically exits once an admin account changes his own UserType or NRIC, or an admin deletes his own account.
* **Alternative 2:** Logging in is now a command, where LoginCommand extends Command. After which the MainWindow creates the initializes the CommandBox with UserType and NRIC.
** Pros: This is easier to implement, since the command functionality has already been set up. Logic operations now handled by Logic class, UserType and NRIC can be final attribute of CommandBox as well. After the admin changes his own UserType or NRIC, a new commandbox may be initialized with the new fields, instead of exiting the program.
** Cons: Difficult to hide the password text this way, as we have to change how the command box textArea functions to hide password text. We also have to change the command in such a way that the logger does not save the command, since we do not want the the username and password being shown in the logger.

==== Aspect: handling commands that require UI changes
For example, the ExitCommand, HelpCommand, ListCommand, ViewNextCommand.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** An enum type (UiCommandInteraction.java) exists for each kind of possible UI change in the program. For example, there is a UiCommandInteraction.EXIT and UiCOmmandInteraction.CALENDAR_CURRENT.
When ViewCurrentCommand is executed, a CommandResult will have a field that contains the enum type, and the Ui change will be executed based on this enum type.
** Pros: Easy to implement, especially for this iteration of Duty Planner, where there aren't many UI changes.
** Cons: More tedious to implement if there are commands that use more UI changes, due to the possible number of permutations.
For example, if you want a command to update the calendar to the next month, but also show the personnel list view, while bringing up a help window. The switch case can get very huge quickly the more commands there are.

* **Alternative 2 (previous iteration of AB4):** CommandResult has boolean fields "exit" and "showHelp", as well as methods "isExit()" and "isShowHelp()".
After executing the command, the CommandResult is checked for each off these fields, and the relevant UI change is executed for each of the boolean fields.
** Pros: Easy to implement, does not have the downside of the previous alternative, since each field only needs to be checked once, so the number of checks only grows linearly with the possible number of UI changes.
** Cons: Very tedious and more prone to error. For example, in AB4, the ExitCommand returns new CommandResult(message, false, true). If there are many fields like DutyPlanner 1.4, it will be CommandResult(message, false, true, false, false, false), which is both tedious for most commands, and prone to error in the long run, especially if even more UI changes are implemented.
** Possible fix for cons: Similar to how a PersonBuilder is used to AB4, testcases, create a CommandResultBuilder class, with UI fields being the same as Command Result, but all UI fields false by default.
To create a command result that shows help and shows the list, simply use: new CommandResultBuilder().withHelp().withList().build().
This should reduce tediousness and results in less errors.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The [W15 - 4] team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParser.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParser.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]

==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/PersonnelDatabase.java[`PersonnelDatabase`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/PersonnelDatabase.java[`PersonnelDatabase`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/PersonnelDatabase.java[`PersonnelDatabase`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`PersonnelDatabase`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `PersonnelDatabase#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your personnel database application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/PersonnelDatabaseSystemTest.java[`PersonnelDatabaseSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and PersonnelDatabaseSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handlePersonnelDatabaseChangedEvent(PersonnelDatabaseChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the personnel database.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the personnel database to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the personnel database storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupPersonnelDatabase(ReadOnlyPersonnelDatabase)`, so that the personnel database can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/PersonnelDatabaseStorage.java[`PersonnelDatabaseStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonPersonnelDatabaseStorage.java[`JsonPersonnelDatabaseStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `personneldatabase`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParser.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParserTest.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParser.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/PersonnelDatabaseParserTest.java[`PersonnelDatabaseParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonPersonnelDatabase.json`, `typicalPersonsPersonnelDatabase.json`, `validPersonnelDatabase.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
