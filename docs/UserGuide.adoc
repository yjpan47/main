== Introduction

MINDEF Duty Planner is a platform to assist military units in the SAF in the assignment of daily guard duties amongst the servicemen. +
The application is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The software is designed to automate the process of fairly assigning duties to available servicemen for an entire month. +
The application can be used by both Commanders and servicemen to plan and view duties with various specific commands for each type of user. +
To start using MINDEF Duty Planner you can go to <<Quick Start>> +
To see a summary list of commands you can go to <<Command Summary>>

== Notation

* Words that are highlighted with a grey background
represent a  `command` that is present or used in the
application.

* Words that are highlighted in white represent a kbd:[keyboard] button that
can be pressed to invoke a described function.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Log in into the system as an admin or a general user. NRIC corresponds to the username. Both the NRIC and the password are case-sensitive.

* For admin account: NRIC is Admin, password is Admin
* For general account: NRIC is the user's NRIC, password is NRIC by default which can be changed.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all personnel
* **`add`**`n/John Doe nr/S9012345N p/98765432 c/Echo s/2 r/CFC t/injured`  : adds a personnel named `John Doe` to the Personnel Database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
.  Some commands can only be accessed by Admin type accounts and some by General type accounts.

// end::penalizeAdmin[]

// tag::settingsAdmin[]
==== View and edit duty settings (points and manpower needs for each day of the week) : `settings`
View and edit duty settings. Duty settings refer to the *manpower needed* and *points rewarded* for each duty based on the day of the week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, etc) 

Format: `settings [d/DAYOFWEEK m/MANPOWER p/POINTS]`

`DAYOFWEEK`: Mon / Tue / Wed / Thur / Fri / Sat / Sun (spelling out the entire a of the week e.g. Monday, Tuesday etc. works as well) +
`MANPOWER`: Number ranging from 1 to 10 +
`POINTS`: Number ranging from 1 to 100

Calling the command `settings` alone displays the current duty settings while calling the command `settings` with the day of the week, manpower and points enables the editing of the duty settings. 

Note that updated duty settings will only take effect the next time a schedule is confirmed. If schedule for next month has already been confirmed, the confirmed schedule will still follow the specifications of the previous duty settings. 

Examples:

* `settings` +
Displays the duty settings - for each day of the week, the manpower needed and points to be rewarded.
* `settings d/sun m/3 p/4` +
Duty settings edited. Sunday duties now require 3 persons and 4 points will be rewarded to each person assigned a Sunday duty.
* `settings d/monday m/2 p/3` +
Duty settings edited. Monday duties now require 2 persons and 3 points will be rewarded to each person assigned a Monday duty.   
// end::settingsAdmin[]

==== Scheduling duties : `schedule`
This command invokes the scheduling algorithm for the upcoming month. It generates a viable duty schedule roster where each duty slot for the upcoming month will be filled by the people currently in the database. ++

.In order to ensure fair scheduling system,
. We introduce a point system to each individual such that a servicemen can earn points by doing duties. The points awarded to servicemen are cumulative, thus the points awarded are carried over to the next month. +
. Each duty is worth a certain number of points and a person gains that amount of points by doing that duty. For example, if all Sunday duties are worth 4 points, a servicemen who is assigned a Sunday duty will by awarded 4 points. +
. Before the scheduling command is called, each person has the opportunity to indicate the days in which they are unavailable to do duty. (See 3.2.8 block command)  +


The algorithm is optimized such that persons with low points will be allocated to duties with high points. It automatically attempts to balance out the points of each person by the end of the month. +

The duty schedule generated by the schedule command is not deterministic, calling schedule command multiple times generates different duty allocation. +

Calling the schedule command merely generates a viable schedule, but does not finalize the schedule (i.e. points awarded to each person is yet to be added). Schedule generated is also not deterministic, calling schedule command multiple times generates different duty allocation. Thus, the admin can call schedule command continuously until a satisfactory schedule is produced. To finalize the schedule, use the confirm command. (See 3.4.6 confirm schedule) +

Format: `schedule`

==== Confirm a Schedule : `confirm`
Confirm and finalize the last generated duty schedule (from the schedule command) for the upcoming month. +
Subsequent attempts to call schedule command will not result in any new duty allocation produced. +

****
* Schedules can only be confirmed if all of the duties are filled.
* The duties are only saved after confirming.
****

Format: `confirm`

=== Saving the data

Duty roster personnel list and the duties allocated are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: What if I want to swap my duty with another person? +
*A*: Use "swap" command to request a swap. If you receive no updates about it, contact your administrator.

*Q*: What is the main feature of this app? +
*A*: The main feature is the automated duty allocation system, which significantly minimizes the amount of work that the admin has to do.

*Q*: What is my username and password? +
*A*: Your username is by default your NRIC, used so prevalently in the SAF. +
Your password is also your NRIC by default, unless you or your administrator changed it. you can use the 'edit' command to edit your password later on. +

*Q*: What if I forgot my password? +
*A*: Contact your administrator for help.

*Q*: What should I do if I need help with the app? +
*A*: You can enter 'help' in the command line, or press Help > Help, or simply press F1. This will open up the User Guide in a new window.
